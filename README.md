# Pokemon GO Data
 
Motivation
==========
My mother is an avid Pokemon GO player, with an account at Level 47 and a collection that consistently maxes out the backpack capacity. It's also given her an activity to do with her friends, since they were already going on walks together and this gave them an extra aspect to their routine. From a video game perspective, she has really mechanically gifted (used to be top 10 on the Fruit Ninja leaderboard while toying with opponents) and incredibly persistent. However, since playing Pokemon GO for her is both a hobby and a means of physical activity, she's never thought too much about optimizing her teams for either PvE or PvP play. She has found some online resources, including moveset grading and IV calculators, but she never really went into battles with a plan other than to tap and hope for the best. She also has the disadvantage of never having played the original Pokemon series of games, so her memorization of Pokemon types and strengths/resistances is her main blind spot for a game like Pokemon GO, which rewards avoiding losing matchups and acknowledging that certain Pokemon, Pokemon movesets, and teams are just better in the meta than others.
